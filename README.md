# Loowis Component Library

## What is this?

This repository is a collection of components I use in my personal websites. I created this library mainly as a way to learn about creating packages and release workflow but also to help bring a cohesive design language across all of my personal websites.

## What components are available?

- Header
- Button
- Polaroid

## How do I use it?

### Step 1

`npm i loowis-component-library`

### Step 2

Add the import for the library's CSS at the top level of your JSX e.g in your _app.js.

`import 'loowis-component-library/dist/index.css';`

### Step 3

Import and use whatever component you wish

`import { Header } from 'loowis-component-library'`

`<Header />`
